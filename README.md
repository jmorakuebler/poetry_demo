# Poetry Demo

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate how to implement Python Poetry into you Python/Django project. You can read the article here (pending link).

Python Poetry is a very powerful tool for managing dependencies, it can be compared with npm. You can group dependencies to avoid unnecessary install (main, dev, test, etc) and update them based on the version constraints you set.

Poetry relies on a `toml` file to configure the project and a `lock` file to pin the dependencies and sub-dependencies versions.

Besides dependency management, you can also build and publish your own packages, and even expand Poetry's functionality with plugins.

To learn more about Python Poetry you can check its documentation page at https://python-poetry.org/docs/.
